My-Public-Python-repository
===========================

These are all my complete, ready-to-go python programs. All others will go into my unfinished repository.

Includes:
=========
My Number Guessing game
My Calculator
My Python Editor

Instructions: Number guessing game
==================================
This is pretty straight forward.
All you need to do is guess the random number between 1 and 20 (that includes 1 and 20).

Instructions: Calculator
========================
This is a very simple calculator. I will enhance it later on, but it works fine as it is.
All you need to do is enter your type of equation, your first integer, and your second integer.
Then it will do all the math.

Instructions: Python Editor
===========================
More like Python File Creator. Anyways, this is like IDLE, exept it is not very enhanced(I will later on), and you can't edit any python files with it, only create.
First, enter in the file name, then the code. When you're finished, type in save.(Typing in save will not effect your code.)
The program saves every single line of code to the file after you type it in, so you can easily recover from crashes. This also helps the program save it properly.
